# Sentence Alignment Tools

This repository contains the code that can be used to align sentences accross articles adopted to different readability levels.
The current code is designed to be used specifically with the [Newsela Data](https://newsela.com/data/). The code is an implementation of a modified version of the algorithm described by [Paetzold and Specia](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.04113.pdf) can be used to obtain datasets for CWI (Complex Word Identification) tasks. Please, note that the 
newer version of this code is now a part of [another repository](https://github.com/seanderson/lexical-simplification/tree/master/src).
