Implements the algorithm described by Gustavo Herique Paetzold and Lucia Specia
in "Vicinity-Driven Paragraph and Sentence Alignment for Comparable Corpora", University of Sheffield, UK.


absp(int par, int sent, boolean inFirstArticle): converts the sentence's position given relative to the beginning of
paragraph to that given by the sentence's absolute position in the document


relp(int sent, boolean inFirstArticle): inverse of absp


calculate_cosine_similarity(v0, v1): calculate the cosine similarity between two given vectors


rel_sent_sim(int p0, int s0, int p1, int s1, v0, v1): calculate the cosine similarity between two given sentences,
if it was not calculated previously. Return the calculated value. Use relative sentence coordinates.


abs_sent_sim(sent0, sent1, v0, v1, ind0, ind1): Calculate the cosine similarity between two given sentences, if it was
not calculated previously. Return the calculated value. Use absolute sentence coordinates.

compare_sent_sim(sent0, sent1, v0, v1, ind00, ind01, ind10, ind11): Returns the difference between the cosine
similarities of the two pairs of sentences. Uses absolute sentence coordinates


build_tf_idf(rawVectors, parFq, totalW): get the TF vectors for some set of sentences and a TF vector for the paragraph(s)
that contains all these sentences. Return the TF-IDF vectors


paragraph_similarity(ind0, ind1): calculate the similarity between two given paragraphs if it was not calculated
previously. Return the calculated value.


create_sentence_alignment(tuple_of_coordinates start, next, lists aligned0, aligned1, lists_of_lists_of_vectors v0, v1,
arrays sent0, sent1): This method is called every time a new sentence alignment is found.


align_sentences(sent0, sent1, v0, v1): Takes an array with sentence indexes and TF_IDF vectors as input and uses
(paper: Algorithm2:Sentence Alignment) algorithm to find the alignments among them.


sentence_function(last, next, pars): Function used in euclidean.closest for sentence alignment.


pars_to_sents(pars, sentInd): receive the list of paragraphs' indexes and convert it to an array of absolute
indexes of sentences that appear in these paragraphs


clean_sent_matrix(list_of_ints pars0, list_of_ints pars1): delete all previously calculated entries in the sentSim
matrix if they represent similarities between the sentences from given paragraphs


add_freq(indexes, originals): add together the entries at the same positions in the parFreq arrays. Conceptually,
it merges the term frequency statistics of a set of paragraphs so that the whole set can be perceived as one paragraph.


merge_lists(indexes, originals): merges lists that occupy specified positions in variable originals, which
should itself be a list. Returns one list


create_paragraph_alignment(last, next, pars0, pars1): Create a paragraph alignment. Update and return new last variable.
If this is one-to-one alignment - call align_sentences method.


paragraph_function(last, next):Function used in euclidean.closest for paragraph alignment


align_paragraphs(int a0, int a1): aligns paragraphs using the Vicinity-Driven Paragraph Alignment algorithm.


delete_stopwords(words): Take a list of words and return the list of all words in this list which are not in stopwords


fill_dictionary(dict, parFreq, wordsTotal, article, sentVectors, wordCount): Fill the ditionary with the words from the
given article. Return the number of distinct words in the dictionary. Calculate the term frequency for the paragraphs,
the number of words in each paragraph, and also the term frequency for the sentences


set_up(a0, a1): get the text of the two articles and set up all the arrays and
lists that will be needed later during the alignment.


write_result(slug, loLevel, hiLevel, allParagraphs): print the results of the alignment
to the files in the output directory


def extract_results(): converts the results of the paragraphs' alignment from the matrix to a list
(from parResultMatrix to parResult)


sim_in_articles(slug, paragraphs, levels):  Pairwise compare the levels (given by the levels parameter) of the
 article, given by paragraphs - the list of the tokenized articles with this slug (obtained
 from newselautils.getTokParagraphs)


align_first_n(nToAlign = -1, levels = [(0, 1, 2), (1, 2, 2), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 2), (4, 5, 2)]):  Load the information
about the articles and process n slugs by comparing the levels as specified in the levels variable.


align_particular(slugs, levels = [(0, 1, 2), (1, 2, 2), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 2), (4, 5, 2)]):  Does the same as
align_first_n but only for specified slugs
